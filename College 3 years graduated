Section 1: The Difference Between School and Work Experience
Intro (0:30 - 1 minute)
In school, you're paying for experience. While the work might be challenging, it’s often simplified, and there are no "make it or break it" moments. 
In contrast, when you’re working, the stakes are higher. You’re paid for your expertise, and results are expected.

Body (1 - 1.5 minutes)
In the workplace, you learn not just the technical side of IT and networking, but also essential communication and soft skills that are crucial for success. 
Being good at your job isn’t just about technical competence. It’s about how effectively you can communicate, which isn’t something schools typically emphasize enough.

Ending (0:30 - 1 minute)
Transitioning from school to work was a culture shock. It's not only about mastering the technical aspects but also developing the soft skills that are often overlooked. Learning to communicate effectively can have a huge impact on your success at work.

Section 2: Skill Gaps at the Entry and Mid-Level
Intro (0:30 - 1 minute)
School gives you a broad overview of technology, but it’s up to you to dive deeper into the subjects that matter most.

Body (1 - 1.5 minutes)
Although some topics in school are covered at a high level, the pace is often too fast to fully understand complex subjects. That’s why it’s so important to ask questions and dig deeper, even after class. Personally, some of my best insights came from following what I call "question rabbit holes" — constantly asking myself, “Do I truly understand this?” or “Could I explain this to a colleague or senior engineer?”

Ending (0:30 - 1 minute)
It's crucial to explore those rabbit holes when it comes to hard topics. You need to understand the fundamentals, and not just skim the surface. 
That deeper understanding is what will set you apart in your career.

Section 3: The Importance of Communication and Soft Skills
Intro (0:30 - 1 minute)
Soft skills get mentioned in school, but their importance becomes very real in the workplace. It’s about balancing both personal and professional communication.

Body (1 - 1.5 minutes)
Early in my career, I thought my success was 90% about technical skills and 10% about communication. 
But after graduating, I realized it was more like 70% technical, 30% soft skills. 
Three years into my career, it's closer to 50/50. No matter your role, even in IT, strong communication skills are just as important as technical knowledge.

The best engineers I’ve worked with have found a way to master both sides. They know their tech, but they’re also able to explain it to others and collaborate effectively.

Ending (0:30 - 1 minute)
Developing these non-technical skills is something that happens both in and out of the office. 
It requires conscious effort, but it’s essential for long-term success. Make it a priority to develop these skills, just like you would with your technical knowledge.
